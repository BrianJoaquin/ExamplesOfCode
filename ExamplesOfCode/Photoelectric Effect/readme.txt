The Physics Behind the Code:

The photoelectric effect is the physical phenomena in which metals emit electrons when hit with a beam of light.
In 1905 Albert Einstein predicted that the phenomena could be explained by light being composed of quantum particles called photons whose energy would be the frequency of the light wave multiplied by a constant (Planck’s constant).
This theory would be tested by physicist Robert Andrews Millikan, who recorded the kinetic energies of ejected electrons and the frequency of light that ejected them, and graphed them.
Millikan’s graph confirmed Einstein’s predictions, showing that there was indeed a constant multiple that described the energy of the electron, which turned out to be Planck’s constant.

Code:

Using the data Millikan acquired and using the least squares formula of slope (𝑆𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒=𝑆𝑆𝑥𝑥/𝑆𝑆𝑥𝑦), I attempt to graph the data and create a line-of-best fit. 
If the line’s slope is Planck’s constant it proves Einstein’s prediction (Spoiler alert: Einstein was right).
